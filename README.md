# Cplusplus

#These files consist of all the labs I've completed and the first project I did in CS-210
All of these have passed all the tests required for the labs and showcases comprehension in course material

#Project One
Project One consisted of creating a clock that could be manually updated using both 12H and 24H formats
using specified stylization from the client allowing for adding time manually. It should be noted that
there are ways to automatically update time that were outside the scope of the course's material, but could
have been implemented by previously knowledgeable programmers. For the sake of simplicity that this course
provides though, only the scope of what was learned so far was implented in this project.

#The Good
The project met all the requirements for the project and met specifications required

#The Bad
The project took quite a long time and constant revisions and help to get it to work

#The Ugly
Though it met expectations, the final functionality of the clock doesn't work and I couldn't fix it in time
Though I'm sure it only needs minor revisions to work properly and update the time as intended, it's still unfinished
